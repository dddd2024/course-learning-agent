"""Text chunking strategies for material content.

The chunker takes the text extracted by :mod:`app.retrieval.parsers`
and splits it into retrieval-sized pieces. The default target length
is 600 characters with a 100-character overlap, which keeps each chunk
within the 500-800 range requested by the design while preserving
context across chunk boundaries.

Two entry points are provided:

* :func:`chunk_text` operates on a single string and is the building block.
* :func:`build_chunks` takes the ``[(page_no, text), ...]`` list produced
  by ``parse_file`` and yields chunks that retain their originating
  page number, with globally sequential ``chunk_index`` values.

Heading detection (``第X章`` / ``X.`` / ``# `` / ``Chapter N``) is used
to prefer section boundaries; long sections without headings fall back
to length-based slicing with overlap.
